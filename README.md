I have exciting plans for the future of Smart Pantry, and I am always looking to make it even better. Here are some upcoming enhancements:

1. **Automating Text Extraction:** I am working on automating the process of extracting text from images, making it even more user-friendly.

2. **Mobile Application:** I am developing a mobile application that will allow users to easily capture images of products, making inventory management on the go a breeze.

3. **Meal Planning:** My next big feature is the integration of a meal planning system. Users will be able to create weekly or monthly meal plans based on the ingredients available in their pantry.

4. **Expanded OCR Database:** Currently, my OCR system is trained on a limited set of 20 images due to time constraints. In the future, I aim to expand this database to cover a wider range of products and improve accuracy.
